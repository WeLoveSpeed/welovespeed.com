title: "React / Next  vs INP : le clash"
subtitle: ~
excerpt: |
  Popular JS frameworks are constantly displaying their benchmarks to prove that they are fast, even better than the native DOM! But the arrival of INP and my 5 years of accelerating these stacks for my clients show that on normal sites, i.e. with several hundred instances of components per page, you need a hell of a lot of tooling, expertise and even cunning to avoid killing the user experience.

  So I'm sharing with you my feedback on the different versions of Next / React, a bit of Vue / Nuxt and even Svelte or web components, the tricks that helps and my methodology for making it last.
