  The new Google metric “Interaction to Next Paint (INP)” https://web.dev/articles/inp, which measures how responsive a site is responsive to user inputs, has become effective as a Core Web Vital in March.

  By analyzing some case studies based on my work, you will understand what you should do (or not do) to ensure that your site maintains good responsiveness to user interactions.

  During this talk we will see:
  - What the new INP metric measures
  - How I debugged slow interactions using RUM data and Chrome developer tools
  - 3 case studies of slow interactions: the cause, the recommendation, the action, the solution
  - Do's and don'ts to keep your website responsive to user input
