title: "Performance Is Good for Brains!"
subtitle: ~
excerpt: |
  User experience and web performance are among the best indicators of online business outcomes. Faster websites have happier users. Those happy users visit longer and spend more. But why is that?

  By looking back at the history of UX, web performance research, and the new metrics that are just around the corner, you'll understand why slow sites enrage you, and why you prioritize making your sites and apps as fast as possible. We still have so much to learn. But if we stay on course, we’ll get there.

  User experience and web performance are among the best indicators of online business outcomes. Faster websites have happier users. Those happy users visit longer and spend more. But why is that?

  When we think about web performance, it’s easy to fall into an abyss of metrics. Backend time, Start Render, Core Web Vitals, Lighthouse scores... these metrics are useful and necessary, but they’re just a means to an end: 

  Understanding how to create faster, more joyous user experiences.

  We'll walk through a brief history of UX and web performance research, highlighting key studies that connect the dots between performance and user experience and sharing some educated guesses about new metrics that are just around the corner. 

  You'll take away insights into why slow sites enrage you, and why you should prioritize making your own sites and apps as fast as possible for your own users.

  We still have so much to learn. Some day we’ll laugh at how much we assumed and how little we actually knew. But if we stay on course, we’ll get there.
