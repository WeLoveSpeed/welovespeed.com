title: "Boavizta â€” State of the art in assessing the environmental impact of content websites"
subtitle: ~
excerpt: |
  A presentation to bring you up to date on the methods and tools available to assess the environmental impact of content websites (and not necessarily to measure it, as we always say at Boavizta).

  What tools and methods exist? What are their current limitations? Which tools for which types of digital service? These are the questions that will be covered during these 25 minutes.
