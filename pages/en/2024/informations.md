## How do I get there?

### By public transport

#### **Tram**

Line 1 direct from the town center towards Beaujoire, get off at Beaujoire station. It gives access to exhibition center's main entrance. It will be right in front of you as you get off the tram.

Avoid Ranzay station because it gives access to entrance 2 which is closed.

The app Naolib ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.semitan.tan&hl=en&pli=1) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/naolib-tram-bus/id502653639)) will allow you to buy and activate tickets. Ideal if you want to buy those in advance and to be all set when you arrive at Nantes. Don't forget to activate the ticket once you get in the tram, not before.

#### **Bus**

* Line 75 to Beaujoire - Line 80 to Batignolles
* Chronobus C6, Beaujoire stop

### By Train

Nantes is 2 hours by train from Paris.

When you arrive at Nantes station, take the "Gare Nord" exit. The tramway station is opposite the station.

### By plane

The airport is 25 minutes away. You can reach the city center by shuttle bus.

### By car

EXPONANTES has 5,000 parking spaces in the immediate vicinity of the exhibition center. So you won't have any trouble parking.

## Checkroom

A free checkroom is available. You can leave your personal belongings there in complete safety so that you can fully enjoy the experience without taking on too much.

## Food

Each ticket for We Love Speed includes hospitality services during breaks and lunch. You'll be welcomed with pastries, before the presentations begin.

Vegetarians and vegans in particular will find a wide choice of dishes. We invite those with gluten allergies to contact us for tailor-made preparations.
